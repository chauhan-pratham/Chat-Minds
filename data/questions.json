    {
      "question": "Can you describe your work and internship experience?",
      "answer": "I have completed two key internships: a Blockchain Internship at TIET where I built a secure logging prototype on the Solana network, and a Cybersecurity Traineeship with Acmegrade where I executed a simulated Man-in-the-Middle attack to validate browser defenses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could you elaborate on your blockchain internship at TIET?",
      "answer": "Certainly. During the 6-week ELC Summer Internship, my goal was to explore blockchain for log integrity. I built a prototype on the Solana network that used Merkle tree batching to process and verify over 500 Windows Event Logs. You can find the complete source code here: <a href='https://github.com/chauhan-pratham/solana-secure-logging-prototype' target='_blank'>GitHub Repository</a>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What were your responsibilities during the cybersecurity traineeship with Acmegrade?",
      "answer": "At Acmegrade, I was part of a team project to attempt HSTS Hijacking in a simulated MITM attack. I configured tools like Bettercap to intercept traffic and attempt to strip HTTPS. The project confirmed that modern HSTS policies successfully blocked these downgrade attempts. I also automated parts of the process with custom caplets and documented our findings in a technical report."
